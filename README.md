# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple password strength checker implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code allows users to enter a password and visually indicates its strength using a strength bar and a message.

## Getting Started

To use the password strength checker, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The password input field will be displayed along with a toggle button to show or hide the password. As you type in the password, the strength bar will update to reflect the strength level, and a corresponding message will be displayed.

## Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are required to use the password strength checker. However, a web browser that supports JavaScript is necessary.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the password strength checker.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for checking the password strength.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout for the password strength checker.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a password in the input field.
3. The strength bar will update dynamically, indicating the strength level of the password.
4. A corresponding message will be displayed below the strength bar to describe the strength level.

You can also toggle the visibility of the password by clicking on the eye icon next to the input field.

## Customization

If you want to customize the appearance or behavior of the password strength checker, you can modify the `style.css` file to change the styles, or update the `script.js` file to adjust the password strength criteria or modify the messages.
